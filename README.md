## Intro

This project is a Udacity assignment.  This was written by a student, not a professional.  Clone at your own risk.  Your laptop may explode!

## Instructions

There are 5 enemy bugs that traverse the paving stones comprising the speedway.  The player must
cross the bug speedway to the lake to win.  The player will loose if a bug collides with the player.

Players can earn points by capturing prizes.  A prize is captured by moving onto a paving stone having a prize.  The gems, the star, the heart, and the key are each worth 10 points.  The boulder
is worth -10 points.  Avoid the boulder!

The game can be reset by clicking on the reset button.

The player can be changed by clicking on the menu button, selecting a new player, and then clicking on the close button.

## Intro

This project is a Udacity assignment.  This was written by a student, not a professional.  Clone at your own risk.  Your laptop may explode!

## Instructions

There are 5 enemy bugs that traverse the paving stones comprising the speedway.  The player must
cross the bug speedway using the arrow keys to get to the lake.  The game is won when the player reaches the lake.  The game is lost if a bug collides with the player.  Avoid the bugs!

Players earn points by capturing prizes.  A prize is captured by moving onto a paving stone having a prize.  The gems, the star, the heart, and the key are each worth 10 points.  The boulder
is worth -10 points.  Avoid the boulder!

The game can be reset by clicking on the reset button.

To change the player, click on the menu button, select a new player, and then click on the close button.
